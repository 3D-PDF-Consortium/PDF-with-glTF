#### Presentation - Khronos Group
Neil gave a presentation that addressed the questions that the Discussion Group had submitted. [Here is a link to that presentation](../presentations/glTF Update to ISO TC 171 SC 2 Mar21.pdf).

##### KTX
super compression is part of the normative spec.

##### Standards
Khronos is using JTC 1 for standardization of glTF.

Khronos is using markdown for their documents. Leonard offered help for converting to ISO template MS Word/PDF.

##### Extensions
Khronos is working to define what (if any) extensions will be in the first standards submission. They looking for use cases as inputs to their decisions. 

glTF is extensible. Any company can create a vendor extension and Khronos maintains a registry. If there are multiple companies, they call it a ext. 

Next level up is KHR extension. Same process as core spec. Extension is ratified and supported by Khronos.

Next level up from that is adding extension to core.

All new Khronos work can be found on the [Khronos Group GitHub page](https://github.com/KhronosGroup).
