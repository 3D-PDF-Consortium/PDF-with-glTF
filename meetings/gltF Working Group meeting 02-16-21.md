## Scope

The group agreed that the goal of the discussion group is to define how to losslessly incorporate glTF into PDF. 

The group also agreed that the use cases that the group defines will be used to define the requirements for glTF in PDF. The capabilities of the current PDF implementation of U3D and PRC will not be used as a baseline for glTF capabilities.

## Use Cases

The group agreed to work on the following use cases:

- Creating PDF from  Office style documents including 3D (boris)
- Graphic arts - content from Adobe Dimensions and others (leonard)
- eCommerce - create document from eCommerce site (leonard)
- glTF to PDF - capture 3D web pages (boris)
- PDF to glTF - in HTML (roman)
- Manufacturing (TDP/Digital Thread/Digital Twins) (phil)

## TBD

- What version of glTF will be supported?
- What glTF features will be supported?
- What is done with the glTF XMP metadata when embedded in PDF?
- How do current 3D features of PDF apply to glTF?
